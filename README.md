# BTS - unfinished                 
The power delivery circuitry is about the only thing I have as of yet confirmed to actually function. I finally received my RN52 breakout boards so testing of the audio section of the project can now go ahead. If that works as intended the Teensy code will then be tested. I dont even know if the code will compile as it was written on a computer that does not have an arm compiler installed.
