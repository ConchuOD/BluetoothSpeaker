# BTS - unfinished                 
The power delivery circuitry is about the only thing I have as of yet confirmed to actually function. I finally received my RN52 breakout boards so testing of the audio section of the project can now go ahead. If that works as intended the Teensy code will then be tested. I dont even know if the code will compile as it was written on a computer that does not have an arm compiler installed.

While testing the BTS v1.0 board a number of issues were found and those are being addressed in the v2.0 board which is current a W.I.P. as testing has not been completed. When this testing is in fact complete then and further errors will be rectified and the v2.0 board sent to be made.
